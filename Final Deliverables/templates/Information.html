            <h2 class="hold">Chronic Kindney Disease</h2>
            <p class="par">Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss of kidney function. 
            Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then removed in your urine. 
            Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build up in your body.
            In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you might have few signs or symptoms. 
            You might not realize that you have kidney disease until the condition is advanced.
            Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of kidney damage, usually by controlling the cause. 
            But, even controlling the cause might not keep kidney damage from progressing. 
            Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or 
            a kidney transplant.</p>

                Loss of kidney function can cause a buildup of fluid or body waste or electrolyte problems.

            <p class="par">Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. Potential complications include:
                Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema)
                A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's function and can be life-threatening
                Anemia.<br>
                Heart disease.<br>
                Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures.<br>
                Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility.<br>
                Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures.<br>
                Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection.<br>
                Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium).<br>
                Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus.<br>
                Irreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival.</p>

            <h2 class="hold">Doctor viewport</h2>
            <p class="par">The doctor may perform a CT scan to get a picture of your kidneys and urinary tract to spot any kidney or 
            urinary tract structure problems. Using this test, they can determine if your kidneys are too large or small or 
            have issues like a kidney stone or tumor. They may also choose to biopsy the kidney to check for a specific type of 
            kidney disease, see how much kidney damage has occurred, and help plan treatment. During this procedure, the doctor 
            removes small pieces of kidney tissue and looks at them under a microscope.</p>
